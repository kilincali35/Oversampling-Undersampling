# Oversampling-Undersampling

In a network optimization project, it was required to create an order pool according to future demand forecast. But there are many features of an exact order, not just demand volume for a company. So, I developed a python model based on Undersampling-Oversampling algorithms in order to create a fictional order pool based on forecast volumes. Then we used this fictional dataset as an input for our network optimization algorithm.
